I have published a new version of my tabletop RPG, [Murdham](https://murdham.azureorangutan.com).
The core of the rules has mostly stayed the same, but they have been improved in various ways:
* **Readability**.
  I have tried to make the rules more concise and clear, simplifying them further wherever possible.
* **Content**.
  I have tweaked all content to maximize readability and fun: skills, traits, items, careers, spells, monsters...
* **Game flow**.
  I have described the flow of the game more explicitly.
  It is somewhat implied in most RPG rules, but I wanted to spell out a rather systematic turn-based approach to the game.
  In particular, the whole game is played in rounds, not just combat.
* **Spells**.
  Sacred spells can now also be enhanced and cast as rituals.
  All spells now have the same default range and duration for simplicity, and they all have specific enhancements.
* **Character sheet**.
  I have created a new, improved character sheet.

Please go ahead and try the game!
I would be happy to hear your feedback in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/58Kbfb2YwX)!.
